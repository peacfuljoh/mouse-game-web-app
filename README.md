# Mouse game web app

This is a simple web app inspired by a game called "Rodent's Revenge" that was created by folks at Microsoft in the 90s. I implemented this simplified take on it as a Javascript learning project.

To play, clone the repo (or directly download it) and double-click on index.html to launch the app in a browser. Enjoy!
